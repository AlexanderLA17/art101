			<h1>Lab 4: Psedocoding and Problem-Solving ART 101</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Me and my partner were tasked with Psuedo coding different steps
					that a student would need to take for an everyday task, as well as how
					to code a simple game .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't run into any problems with this lab as it was pretty self
						explanatory. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot of energy into this assignment. I ended up doing it last minute despite initially wanting to get it down earlier, but
						there were communication problems that led us to working on it later. </p>

<p>How to refill a tire. (instructions from ChatGPT)</p>

</p>Step-by-Step Instructions:</p>
						
</p>1. Find the Recommended Pressure</p>

</p>Look on the inside of your driver’s side door or check your owner’s manual. It’ll be listed in PSI (pounds per square inch).</p>
						
</p>Don’t use the number on the tire’s sidewall—that’s the max limit, not the recommended pressure.</p>
						
</p>2. Remove the Valve Cap</p>

</p>Unscrew the little cap on the tire’s air valve (looks like a small metal or plastic nozzle).</p>
						
</p>3. Check the Current Pressure</p>

</p>Press your tire pressure gauge onto the valve stem.</p>
						
</p>It might hiss briefly, but hold it firmly until you get a reading.</p>
						
</p>4. Add Air if Needed</p>

</p>If the pressure is too low, use an air compressor:</p>
						
</p>Plug it in (or use a coin-operated one at a gas station).</p>
						
</p>Attach the air hose to the valve stem—push it in snugly.</p>
						
</p>Squeeze the trigger (or press the lever, depending on the model).</p>
						
</p>Air will begin to flow. Add air in small bursts to avoid overinflating.</p>
						
</p>5. Recheck the Pressure</p>

</p>Use your gauge to measure again.</p>
						
</p>Keep adjusting until you hit the target PSI.</p>
						
</p>6. Replace the Valve Cap</p>

</p>Screw the valve cap back on so no dirt or moisture gets in.</p>
						
</p>7. Repeat for All Tires</p>

</p>Follow the same steps for the rest of the tires.</p>

<h2>Pseudocode a Simple Game</h2>

					
</p>Hangman:</p>

</p>Create a counter that will make you lose the game when 6 guesses have failed.</p>
						
</p>Create a word limit which should be longer or shorter depending on how difficult you want the game to be.</p>
						
</p>Create a random word generator API using something like Supabase or manually add words yourself.</p>
						
</p>Accept user input. (Restrict to letter guesses only)</p>

</p>Evaluate possible moves (can’t guess same letter twice)</p>
						
</p>Restrict letters not used in word or phrase.</p>
						
</p>Play with a friend and try to guess the phrase before them!</p>
