			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Varriables</h1>
			<p>experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<p>I couldn't get the formatting for the images to work
				this time around, so I copied the formatting from a
				previous lab. I also didn't work with a partner this
			time around.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, my laptop decided that it would no longer charge.
				I purchased a new charger and am hoping the solution is as simple
				as that.<p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>I got everything working in the end! I also recloned
				my repository so now my file structure is normal again. 
				I  also resized the image so thatit wouldn't take up the entire screen.</p>
