			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

			<p>experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<p>I ran into issues regarding the code on the screenshot not actually working.</p>
			<p>It took me a while to figure out what was actually wrong and I ended up using ChatGPT to figure it out.</p>

			<p>However, I did not work a partner this time around either.<p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>I finished everything effectively and the website is up and running.</p>
			<p>I am very please with the result. </p>
