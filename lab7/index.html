			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

			<p>Write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<p>One of the challenges I faces although very small, was actually getting the folders</p>
      <p>and formatting to work properly.</p>
  

			<p>However, I did not work a partner this time around either.<p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>I finished everything effectively and the website is up and running.</p>
			<p>I am very please with the result. </p>
