			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>

			<p>From your console experiment with arrays and objects.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<p>I found it very simple to get the website up and running this time around.</p>

			<p>However, I did not work a partner this time around either.<p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>I got everything working in the end. One of the things that is frusturating is that my laptop decided to stop charging.</p>
			<p>The charger arrives tomorrow, so I will pick it up then. </p>
